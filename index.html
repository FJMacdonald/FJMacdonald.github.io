/*
Set Up Your Website: Create the structure of your website using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. 
You'll need an HTML file to create the user interface, a CSS file for styling,
 and a JavaScript file to handle the file upload and D3.js visualization.

Create the User Interface: 
Design the user interface where users can upload their CSV files. You can use HTML form elements 
and styling to create an intuitive and user-friendly interface.

Implement File Upload Functionality: Write JavaScript code to handle the file upload process. 
Use the File API to allow users to select and upload CSV files from their local device. 
You'll also need to handle the file upload event and read the contents of the uploaded CSV file.

Parse and Process the CSV Data: Once the CSV file is uploaded, parse its contents using JavaScript. 
You can use libraries like Papa Parse to parse CSV data easily. Process the data as needed to prepare 
it for visualization with D3.js.

Visualize the Data with D3.js: Use D3.js to create custom visualizations based on the data from the CSV file. 
You can create various types of charts, graphs, or other visualizations to present the data in a special way 
according to your requirements.

Test Your Website: Before deploying your website, thoroughly test it to ensure that the file upload and
visualization functionalities work correctly across different browsers and devices.
Deploy Your Website: Once you're satisfied with your website, deploy it to your chosen hosting platform. 
Follow the instructions provided by the hosting platform to deploy your website for free.

Share Your Website: Share the URL of your website with others so they can upload their CSV files and explore
 the visualizations you've created with D3.js.
By following these steps, you can create a free website that allows users to upload CSV files
 and presents the data in a special way using D3.js for visualization.
